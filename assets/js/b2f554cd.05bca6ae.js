The problem is that it is such a vast field and after 35+ years, I have quite a bit to share. So, how to do? Then it dawned on me. I need to create a complete pre-university course, covering all aspect of becoming a full stack software developer, teaching you how to build industry-standard enterprise applications. \\n\\nThere are many courses teaching you how to learn the Java programming language, for example. Using a carpentry analogy, for me, learning Java is like teaching you how to use a hammer. The thing is, you are not really interested in hammers. You are really interested in building furniture. Now if you make hammers for a living, this analogy of mine falls flat on its face.\\n\\nIt turns out that learning to use a hammer is just a necessary skill required in the furniture building process. So, you can be a master with a hammer, and at the same time have no clue how to build furniture. The Becoming a Programmer Academy is to be that place to teach you how to build furniture as well as how to use a hammer. \\n\\nNow, obviously, you have to replace the word \\"hammer\\" with \\"Java\\" and the word \\"furniture\\" with applications.\\n\\nRemember I said that I need to create a *pre-university course* that will turn you into a *full stack software developer*, able to build *industry-standard* *enterprise applications*?  Let\'s look at this in more depth.\\n\\n## Pre-University Course\\n\\n## Software Developer\\n\\n### Coder\\n\\n### Programmer\\n\\n### Software Developer\\n\\n## Enterprise Applications\\n\\n### Information Systems\\n\\n### Industry Standard\\n\\n## Full Stack \\n\\n### Front End Developer\\n\\n### Back End Developer\\n\\n### Full Stack Developer\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n**Disclaimer:** I suck at carpentry! So, I am **not** going to teach you how to build tables and chairs and stuff. For that, you can have a look at [Fundamentals of Woodworking](https://www.fundamentalsofwoodworking.com/). On this website, I am going to teach you how to build software applications."}]}')}}]);
