Hi there!

My name is Deon Slabbert and I am a Software Developer from the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. And yes, the older I get, the grumpier I get.

Anyway, after over three decades of building line-of-business/enterprise systems, I have decided that it is time to teach a new generation the things I have learned and experienced over the years.

I hope you will find this site of great value during your programming journey.
