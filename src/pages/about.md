Hi there! 

My name is Deon Slabbert and I am a Software Developer from the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. And yes, the older I get, the grumpier I get.

Anyway, after more than three decades of building line-of-business/enterprise systems, I have decided that it is time to teach a new generation the things I have learned and experienced over the years. 

I sincerely hope that you will find this site of great value in your journey of becoming a programmer.
