Welcome to **The Becoming a Programmer Academy**.

## Introduction

I have been playing around with this idea to put to paper what I have learned over the years in terms of software development. The problem is that it is such a vast field and after 35+ years, I have quite a bit to share. So, how to do? Then it dawned on me. I need to create a complete pre-university course, covering all aspect of becoming a full stack software developer so you can learn how to build enterprise applications. 

There are many courses teaching you how to learn the Java programming language, for example. Using a carpentry analogy, for me, learning Java is like teaching you how to use a hammer. The thing is, you are not really interested in hammers. You are really interested in building furniture. Now if you make hammers for a living, this analogy of mine falls flat on its face.

It turns out that learning to use a hammer is just a necessary skill required in the furniture building process. So, you can be a master with a hammer, and at the same time have no clue how to build furniture. The Becoming a Programmer Academy is to be that place to teach you how to build furniture as well as how to use a hammer. 

Now, obviously, you have to replace the word "hammer" with "Java" and the word "furniture" with applications.

Remember I said that I need to create a *pre-university course* that will turn you into a *full stack software developer*, able to build *enterprise applications*?  Let's look at this in more depth.

## Pre-University Course

## Software Developer

### Coder

### Programmer

### Software Developer

## Enterprise Applications

## Full Stack 

### Front End Developer

### Back End Developer

### Full Stack Developer

## Conclusion

**Disclaimer:** I suck at carpentry. I am **not** going to teach you how to use hammers and build tables and chairs and stuff. I am going to teach you how to build software applications.
