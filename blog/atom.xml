        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to <strong>The Becoming a Programmer Academy</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2><p>I have been playing around with this idea to put to paper what I have learned over the years in terms of software development. The problem is that it is such a vast field and after 35+ years, I have quite a bit to share. So, how to do? Then it dawned on me. I need to create a complete pre-university course, covering all aspect of becoming a full stack software developer so you can learn how to build enterprise applications. </p><p>There are many courses teaching you how to learn the Java programming language, for example. Using a carpentry analogy, for me, learning Java is like teaching you how to use a hammer. The thing is, you are not really interested in hammers. You are really interested in building furniture. Now if you make hammers for a living, this analogy of mine falls flat on its face.</p><p>It turns out that learning to use a hammer is just a necessary skill required in the furniture building process. So, you can be a master with a hammer, and at the same time have no clue how to build furniture. The Becoming a Programmer Academy is to be that place to teach you how to build furniture as well as how to use a hammer. </p><p>Now, obviously, you have to replace the word "hammer" with "Java" and the word "furniture" with applications.</p><p>Remember I said that I need to create a <em>pre-university course</em> that will turn you into a <em>full stack software developer</em>, able to build <em>enterprise applications</em>?  Let's look at this in more depth.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pre-university-course">Pre-University Course<a href="#pre-university-course" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pre-University Course" title="Direct link to Pre-University Course">​</a></h2><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="software-developer">Software Developer<a href="#software-developer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Software Developer" title="Direct link to Software Developer">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="coder">Coder<a href="#coder" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Coder" title="Direct link to Coder">​</a></h3><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="programmer">Programmer<a href="#programmer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Programmer" title="Direct link to Programmer">​</a></h3><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="software-developer-1">Software Developer<a href="#software-developer-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Software Developer" title="Direct link to Software Developer">​</a></h3><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enterprise-applications">Enterprise Applications<a href="#enterprise-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enterprise Applications" title="Direct link to Enterprise Applications">​</a></h2><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="full-stack">Full Stack<a href="#full-stack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Full Stack" title="Direct link to Full Stack">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="front-end-developer">Front End Developer<a href="#front-end-developer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Front End Developer" title="Direct link to Front End Developer">​</a></h3><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="back-end-developer">Back End Developer<a href="#back-end-developer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Back End Developer" title="Direct link to Back End Developer">​</a></h3><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="full-stack-developer">Full Stack Developer<a href="#full-stack-developer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Full Stack Developer" title="Direct link to Full Stack Developer">​</a></h3><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I suck at carpentry.
